Project: Leet code exercises
LeetCode is a popular platform used by software engineers to 
practice technical coding challenges and prepare for job 
interviews. It helps developers sharpen their logic, understand 
data structures, and improve algorithmic efficiency.

This file contains a few foundational exercises to help you 
get started with the LeetCode style of thinking.

# I             1

# Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. 
# However, there are six instances where subtraction is used:
# I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
# X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
# C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

    # to determine if subtraction should occur.

# Test your function with these values:
# print(roman_to_int("III"))     # Expected Output: 3
# print(roman_to_int("LVIII"))   # Expected Output: 58
# print(roman_to_int("MCMXCIV")) # Expected Output: 1994
print(roman_to_int("IV"))     
#print(roman_to_int("LVIII"))   
#print(roman_to_int("MCMXCIV")) 
#print(roman_to_int("IX"))
