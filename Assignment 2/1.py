"""
Project: Scrabble
In this project, you will process some data from a group of friends playing scrabble. 
You will use dictionaries to organize players, words, and points.
There are many ways you can extend this project on your own if you finish and want to get more practice!
If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced developer work through it,

# Initial Data
letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z"]
points = [1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 4, 10]

# --- Build your Point Dictionary ---

# 1. We have provided you with two lists, letters and points. Create a dictionary 
# called letter_to_points that maps each letter to its point value.
letter_to_points={letters[i]:points[i] for i in range(len(letters))}


# 2. Our letters list did not take into account blank tiles. Add an element 
# to the letter_to_points dictionary that has a key of " " and a point value of 0.
letter_to_points[""]=0


# --- Score a Word ---

# 3. We want to create a function that will take in a word and return how 
# many points that word is worth. Define a function called score_word 
# that takes in a parameter word.
def score_word(words):
    


  # 4. Inside score_word, create a variable called point_total and set it to 0.
  point_total=0


  # 5. After defining point_total, create a loop that goes through the letters 
  # in word and adds the point value of each letter to point_total. 
  # If the letter is not in letter_to_points, add 0 to the point_total.
  for word in words:

    if word in letter_to_points:
      point_total+=letter_to_points[word]
    else:
       point_total+=0



  # 6. After the loop is finished, return point_total.
  return point_total


# 7. Let’s test this function! Create a variable called brownie_points and 
# set it equal to the value returned by the score_word() function with 
# an input of "BROWNIE".
brownie_points= score_word("BROWNIE")


# 8. Print out brownie_points to make sure we got it right. 
# (The word BROWNIE should earn 15 points).
print(brownie_points)


# --- Score a Game ---

# 9. Create a dictionary called player_to_words that maps players to a 
# list of the words they have played. This table represents the data 
# to transcribe into your dictionary:
#
# | player1 | wordNerd | Lexi Con | Prof Reader |
# |---------|----------|----------|-------------|
# | BLUE    | EARTH    | ERASER   | ZAP         |
# | TENNIS  | EYES     | BELLY    | COMA        |
# | EXIT    | MACHINE  | HUSKY    | PERIOD      |
player_to_words={"player1":["BLUE","TENNIS","EXIT"]," wordNerd":["EARTH","EYES","MACHINE"],"Lexi Con":["ERASER","BELLY","HUSKY"],"Prof Reader":["ZAP","COMA","PERIOD"]}


# 10. Create an empty dictionary called player_to_points.
player_to_points={}


# 11. Iterate through the items in player_to_words. Call each player player 
# and each list of words words. Within your loop, create a variable 
# called player_points and set it to 0.
for player in player_to_words:
  player_points=0 


  # 12. Within the loop, create another loop that goes through each word 
  # in words and adds the value of score_word() with word as an input.
  for play in player_to_words[player]:
    player_points+=score_word(play) 

  # 13. After the inner loop ends, set the current player value to be 
  # a key of player_to_points, with a value of player_points.
  player_to_points[player]=player_points

# 14. player_to_points should now contain the mapping of players to 
# how many points they’ve scored. Print this out to see the current standings!
print(f"{player_to_points}")


# --- Ideas for Further Practice! ---

# 15. play_word() — a function that takes in a player and a word, 
# and adds that word to the list of words they’ve played.
def play_word(player,words):
  if player in player_to_words:
    player_to_words[player].append(words)
  else:
    player_to_words[player]=words



# 15. update_point_totals() — turn your nested loops into a function 
# that you can call any time a word is played.
def update_point_totals():
  for player,words in player_to_words.items():
    total=0
    for word in words:
      total+=score_word(word)
    player_to_points[player]=total


# 15. Make your letter_to_points dictionary able to handle lowercase inputs.
play_word("Alaa","INFORMATION")
update_point_totals()
print(f"{player_to_points}")
play_word("player1","TECHNOLOGY")
update_point_totals()
print(f"{player_to_points}")
